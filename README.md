This project dives deep into the world of File IO

This file displays skills of using external sources like a .txt file to display a
score-sheet of a basketball team. If the user wishes to input their own values for
such parameters, this project is also capable of doing so. Many concepts of File IO are
persistent such as printStream, .txt files, filesNotFoundException and more.
